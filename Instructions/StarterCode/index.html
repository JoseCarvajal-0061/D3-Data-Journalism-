          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>The scatter plot above displays a positive correlation between poverty and obesity. The trend suggests that there is a higher incidence of obesity
            in states where poeverty levels are high. For example, Missippi, is the poorest state in the nation and ranks the highest in the incidence of obesity.
            While states like Virginia, that have a lower poverty level, show a lower incidence of obesity.

            Unsurprisingly, household income was shown to also have a positive correlation with obesity. States like Virginia where income levels are above average
            show lower levels of obesity. However, a higher household income does not equate to a lack or health risk factors. States with higher income levels are 
            associated with higher levels of smoking. 
          </p>

          <p> As shown in the dataset, age is another social determinant of health. People between the ages of 32 and 40 years old are associated with higher levels of 
            obesity and smoking. </p>
